# ULTRA-CLICK

This game challenges a player to click each image only once. The challenge is that every time you click an image, they shuffle randomly. A point is scored for every image clicked, but if you click one twice, it resets your score to 0. A high score is saved. The images used were from a popular Japanese sci-fi television series from the 1960s.

This game was developed by Brian Nickila, following very specific instructions by the University of Minnesota BootCamp Full-Stack Web Development course.

Programs used: React, JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS.
